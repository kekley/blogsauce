[//]: # (What is this site for, a little bit about me)

## thanks for stopping by!
This is a website! (Mostly) of my own creation where I plan to share my not-so-innermost thoughts and ideas about the things I am currently working on or thinking about. 
I would like to detail what you can expect to see on this page and a little bit about its creation, but before all of that I would like to mention the joy I had helping 
a few of my friends achieve the same thing. You can find their pages at [taxidermycact.us](https://taxidermycact.us/) and [northofpolar.is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqe_Rr_r714).  

My primary motivation for creating a website was a desire to share more about the things I find interesting or otherwise want to talk about 
while also staying away from social media and other equally shitty corporations. 
I've never been particularly fond of participating on social media or any online discourse for that matter 
so I'm still very much trying to figure out what my voice and presence on the internet actually looks and sounds like. please bear with me on that.  

Some specifics about the kind of posts you can expect to see on this page are:  
- my personal programming projects (like this site!)
- informational posts about any concept I want to familiarize myself with
- personal resolutions I want to help hold myself acountable for by sharing them publicly
- and perhaps some journal-esque content that I deem worth posting  

I will also do my best to maintain a gallery of my favorite photos, a list of media I like, and some fun interactive stuff inspired by [this page](https://snoot.org/toys/).

That wraps up the important stuff about the site if you have anything else you should really be doing right about now, 
but if you would like a little tour or some info about the development of the site then read on!
