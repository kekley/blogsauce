NARRATOR: 

(Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard) 
According to all known laws 

of aviation, 


there is no way a bee 
should be able to fly. 


Its wings are too small to get 
its fat little body off the ground. 


The bee, of course, flies anyway 


because bees don't care 

what humans think is impossible. 
BARRY BENSON: 

(Barry is picking out a shirt) 
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. 
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. 


Ooh, black and yellow! 
Let's shake it up a little. 
JANET BENSON: 

Barry! Breakfast is ready! 
BARRY: 

Coming! 


Hang on a second. 
(Barry uses his antenna like a phone)
